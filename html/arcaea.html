    <h2>
       v6.0 Announced, Gekichumai collaboration teased!!!
    </h2>
    
    <p>
          It's almost the end of the year(and roughly 4 months before the next anniversary) and with the leak of the Arcaea x Maimai collaboration some time ago
        as well as them <a href="https://x.com/arcaea_en/status/1853633382313271355" target="_blank">confirming the collaboration from all 3 SEGA arcade rhythm games</a>,
        I honestly did not expect anything else from Lowiro for the rest of 2024 but here we are... VERSION 6.0!!! A brand-new main story song pack 
        with all original songs presents itself before us.. and it's coming in a week!!! oh god oh fuck(in the gladdest tone humanly possible, with tears of joy)
        <br><br>
        So... this, AND the ONGEKI collaboration!??!?
    </p>

        Yap yap yap..
    </h2>
    
    <p>
          My first reaction to the image in this post is towards the unconventional song border color schemes. 
        Typically it would be purplish if the song is conflict-side and white-ish if light-side, and a secret third thing if colorless side, but... 
        this new, almost celestial color seems like a SECRET FOURTH THING TO ME!!! I'm all for having a new side joining into the mix in Arcaea
        and with the colorless side existing we know that it's possible, we just have to see what lowiro is up to now..
        Needless to say I'm looking forward to any other code-level changes to the game too, Toaster better be cooking good
        (Toaster please take a break from programming after this and show us more of your charting style T_T)<br><br>
        Also(A frame near the end of the Trailer), secret song?!!! (pls pls pls)
    </p>

    <h2>
        New illustrator?!
    </h2>

    <p>
        In the spotlight(the thumbnail of the trailer as well as the jacket of Lament Rain) we see a new face, ああもんど, who has
        apparently never worked on illustrations for Arcaea before. For their debut, I will say that it absolutely slaps, 
        being both faithful to the visual theme Arcaea has going on and just outright gorgeous in general. Lowiro really knows
        how to pick the right person for the job...! Looking forward to more illustrations by them, maybe in the story this update!
